Notes on Final Project


Can't use gmapping and amcl at same time because they both would publish to the same odom/tf topic at the same time.

If there is a way to just have the robot map and periodically save the map using map_server map_saver incrementally and open it with amcl we may be able to use it. 

Further research required.

gmapping also provides localization, so just running gmapping to replace the /map topic and localization should be fine.
